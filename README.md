# AFE-SE-Corr
R scripts for analysis of correlation between AFE and SE in GTEx samples

## Overview
This R script orchestrates a multi-sample analysis linking Alternative First Exon (AFE) usage to Skipped Exon (SE) splicing events, computing per-event correlations, stratifying by genomic distance, and exporting BED files for downstream genomic analyses or visualization.
